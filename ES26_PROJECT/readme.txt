This program serves as a final requirement for the course Engineering Science 26 (ENSC26): Computer Applications in Engineering
The program, coded with the help of Visual Basic, aims to aide in the computation of resonant circuits.
User is to input the Voltage (V), Resistor (R), Inductor (L), and Capacitor (C) Values in the circuit. 
The program computes and outputs the resonant frequency (fr), current at ressonance (Ir), Bandwith (BW), and the Quality Factor (Qs).
As an added option, the user can see the graph of the Reactance and Inductance of the given function.
